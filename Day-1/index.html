            In 1972, the Uruguayan Air Force flight 571, chartered to transport a rugby team to Santiago, Chile, experiences 
            an unexpected incident and crashes into a glacier in the heart of the Andes. Of the 45 passengers on board, only 16 manage to survive. Trapped in one of the most inaccessible and hostile environments on the planet, they are forced to resort to cannibalism to stay alive. Their survival will depend on the decisions they make in the midst of this desperate situation.
